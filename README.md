# Mathsnake
## Eat the right fruit
An arithmetic problem is displayed on the top. Your job is to eat the fruit that displays the correct answer. The snake gets bigger and bigger.

## It gets harder...
As your score increases, the snake gets fast... like very fast. The numbers get bigger and bigger... Can you keep eating fruit in the face of adversity?





# Coming Soon
This was a highschool project made in 2024. If I were to ever update this it would be a full re-write with a proper grid system and proper GUI with adjustable settings (resolution, difficulty).

I would also like to extend the scope beyond just arithmetic maths (and snake).
